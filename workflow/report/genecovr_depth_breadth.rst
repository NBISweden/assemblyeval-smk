Depth and breadth of coverage

The ratio depth to breadth of coverage is illustrated in different
ways. The rationale is that this ratio indicates whether or not a gene
is split between several sequences, or present in multiple identical
copies. Plots are conditioned on the number of contigs a gene maps to.
A ratio close to one would indicate a split gene, whereas a ratio
close to the number of mapped contigs ``n`` would indicate a gene
present in ``n`` copies.

``depth_breath_coverage`` plot shows depth/breadth vs gene body
coverage. ``depth_breadth_hist`` and ``depth_breadth_jitter`` tally
the distribution conditioned on number of contigs for genes that map
to >= 2 contigs. ``depth_breadth_seqlengths`` depicts sequence length
distributions conditioned on the number of mapped contigs.
