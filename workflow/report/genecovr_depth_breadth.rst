Depth and breadth of coverage

The ratio depth to breadth of coverage is illustrated in different
ways. The rationale is that this ratio indicates whether or not a gene
is split between several sequences, or present in multiple identical
copies. Plots are conditioned on the number of contigs a gene maps to.
A ratio close to one would indicate a split gene, whereas a ratio
close to the number of mapped contigs `n` would indicate a gene
present in `n` copies.

`depth_breath_coverage` plot shows depth/breadth vs gene body
coverage. `depth_breadth_dataset_hist` tallies the distribution
conditioned on number of mapped contigs.
`depth_breadth_dataset_jitter` shows distribution as a dotplot.
