Gene body coverage plots

Plot shows the number of genes (count) as a function of coverage of
the gene body, expressed as a fraction (min.coverage). Gene body
coverage is calculated as the number of bases that have been mapped
divided by the gene body length, regardless whether any part of the
gene maps to multiple locations. Alignments with fraction matches
lower than a given cutoff (indicated in filename as minmatch.0.##) are
excluded from calculations. The solid line shows the total number of
transcripts. Colored lines represent different data sets.
